            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Elysia (pronounced eh-lee-sea-ah) and I am currently a third year student at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science. I am hoping to find a software engineering internship for summer 2024. I also have experience and interest in cyber security and data science! Please click on the links below to learn more about my past experiences and future aspirations.</p>

            <h2 id="1">Professional Background</h2>

            <h3>Computer Security and Privacy Laboratory</h3>
            <p>Since June 2023, I have been working alongside Doctor Ning Zhang and PhD candidate Oliver Chang on several project regarding computer security in a healthcare setting.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="column-left">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Detecting Videos Harmful for Photosensitive Epilepsy Patients</strong> - For this project, I wrote a program using C++ and pthreads that will detect videos that are known to cause seizures or physical reactions according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/seizures-and-physical-reactions">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</a>. The key criteria for detecting these videos were in regards to the frequency of flashes between frames and area of flash. For every video, I utilized OpenCV to process individual frames and stored the key information with a sliding window approach. Each frame was split into multiple sections processed through pthreads to allow for a faster runtime. This program had an average 34% decrease in runtime for a 40 second video and an average 67% decrease in runtime for a 5 second video compared to previous lab iterations. Please refer to the research poster on the right for more information on the algorithms used to detect the harmful videos.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy in Women's Health Applications</strong> - For this project, I selected and systemized Women's Health Applications on Google Play Store. Next, I wrote scripts to conduct topic analysis on the play store reviews, static analysis on the permissions, libraries, and trackers on each application's APK file, and dynamic analysis with a UI monkey. The results of the analysis were compared to Google Play Store privacy guidelines and each application's privacy policy to identify discrepancies and necessary improvements to data privacy.</li>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>From this experience, I learned about parallel programming and Android application analysis. Additionally, besides those technical skills, I also picked up skills understanding documentation, adapting outdated code, and optimizing runtime.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms Teaching Assistant</h3>
            <p>As a teaching assistant, I hold weekly office hours for students requesting additional help mainly regarding challenging concepts or code debugging. Additionally, around exam week, I volunteer to host the additional review sessions focusing on the current exam's concepts. Besides working directly with students, I also give feedback through assignments and grading. As this course is one of the fundamental courses in my university's computer science cirriculum, I gain the chance to interact with students of various backgrounds and cater my guidance to each student.</p>
